2014:39.22,2014_39_22_hr.jpg,Serving tray,The Kalo Shop,1912-16,"This monogrammed tray is typical of the hand-wrought silver items produced by The Kalo Shop, the leading Chicago producer of silverware for more than three generations. Founded by Clara Barck Welles in 1900, the shop was originally a group of six women. Nicknamed the “Kalo girls,” they were responsible for designing the items produced, while Scandinavian immigrants fabricated them. The Kalo Shop thus offered opportunities for women and immigrants not found elsewhere in Chicago at the time.
 
 The Kalo Shop produced the widest ranges of handmade holloware, jewelry, and flatware in Chicago during the Arts and Crafts movement, but during World War I, their production changed. Silver became scarce, and many of Kalo’s silversmiths were sent overseas to fight in the war. The female employees of the Kalo Shop started producing smaller items and jewelry, enabling the shop to stay open during the war. Unfortunately, their New York storefront, which had opened in 1912 to accommodate a growing east coast clientele, closed in 1916 due to the wartime economy.",,,,,,,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,,

Clara Barck-Welles founded the Kalo Shop in Chicago, Illinois, in 1900 to revive the production of hand-crafted silver in an age in of industrialization. Not bound by the traditional British guild structure, the American Arts and Crafts movement afforded more opportunities for female artisans who would have designed and produced items like these salt and pepper casters.",,,,,,,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,,

Chasing is a process of punching into the surface of the metal by striking a steel tool called a scribe with a hammer. The Mexican workshop of Los Castillos, founded by Antonio Castillo in 1939, often uses this technique to create designs influenced by Mexican folk art. Before opening his own workshop, Antonio trained as a silversmith with William Spratling, whose workshop in Taxco, Mexico is credited with the revival of Mexican silver based on folk designs. Los Castillos continues to make handmade objects today, under the control of Emilia, Antonio’s daughter. Emilia has gained international acclaim for her silver and porcelain designs, which are sold in her storefront in Paris and in the United States by Neiman Marcus department stores.",,,,,,,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,,
